A example of an easy snake game using the Swing toolkit.

# Game guide

The aim of the game is easy. Simply collect as many apples as posible without colliding with either the sides of the window or the rest of your snakes body. 

Use the directional keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to change your snakes direction, and keep track of your score at the top of the window.

The more apples you collect the longer your snakes body becomes, so plan carefully!
